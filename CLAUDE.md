## Project Overview

This is the official documentation site for daily.dev, built using Docusaurus 3. It serves as a comprehensive resource for daily.dev users covering features, guides, and community information.

## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
npm start          # Start development server at localhost:3000
npm run build      # Build for production  
npm run serve      # Serve built site locally
npm run clear      # Clear Docusaurus cache
```

### Docker Development
```bash
npm run docker:compose    # Build and run with docker-compose

- `sidebars.js`: Documentation sidebar structure (auto-generated from docs folder)
- `src/pages/index.js`: Custom homepage component
- `src/css/custom.css`: Global styles and theming

### Content Structure
- `docs/`: All documentation markdown files organized by category
- `static/`: Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
- `src/components/`: React components for homepage and custom elements
- `src/pages/`: Custom pages outside the docs structure

### Important Features
- **Algolia Search**: Integrated search functionality
- **Dark Mode**: Default dark theme with light mode toggle

## Development Notes

### Adding New Documentation
- Create `.md` files in appropriate `docs/` subdirectories
- Use `_category_.json` files to configure category metadata
- Sidebar is auto-generated from folder structure

### Component Development
- Homepage components are in `src/components/homepage/`
- Feature components follow React functional component patterns
- CSS modules are used for component styling

### Asset Management
- Icons and images should be placed in `static/img/`
- Use SVG format for icons when possible
- Images are optimized automatically by the ideal-image plugin

### Deployment
- Production builds are generated in `build/` directory
- Site is configured for deployment to docs.daily.dev
- Vercel configuration is available in `vercel.json`
